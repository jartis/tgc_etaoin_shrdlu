                                <b>ETAOIN SHRDLU</b> is a project about how the world impacts you, and how you impact the world. It is built on a simple premise: Care. Care for yourself, care for others, care about what you're doing, care about how you
                                are feeling.
                            </p>

                                The phrase <b>ETAOIN SHRDLU</b> is a relic from the early days of typesetting. The most common letters were arranged in that order, to make them easier to grab when putting down a new sentence. Much like those are the first
                                letters one would reach for when laying out type, the actions here are the common ones that we all face every day. <b>ETAOIN SHRDLU</b> is my way of bringing a note of positivity into each of those actions.

                                    capturing one moment, one particular embodiment, of a piece of work. The website is built to allow you to make your own experiences for these. The differences in each run are part of the project, part of the fun, and
                                    a way to engage with them - and make them your own.
